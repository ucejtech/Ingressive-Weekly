<p>Hello there,
Awesome techie</p>

<p><i>
    Sorry for the mail hitch last week a few people reached out to notify me that
they found the 'Testing One, Two, Three ...' flagship email in spam on their mailboxes
I sincerely apologize for it, it was basically a glitch from the mail client, after 
15 tests and rechecks. if you didn't get last weeks issue kindly check your spam. Back 
to the issue of the day.

<h2>The Ubuntu Program</h2>

<p><i>
{I am sure you had a tongue-twisting moment when you tried to pronounce them 
the subject of the mail just for you to know that the full version of the word 'UBUNTU' try it one 
more time slowly}
</i></p>

<p>
The Ubuntu Program is a community-wide, six weeks (6) 'Virtual Peer Learning Programme' centred on 
people helping each other learn to programme and own their own learning.
The program starts on September 6th, there are two tracks JavaScript and Python available for 
you to choose from.,<br>
Hurry up application closes on September 7th. Register here bit.ly/ubuntuprogram

<h2>Hardcore Developer</h2>

<p><i>{Hard Developer! Hard Developer!! but you can't code without using frameworks}</i>
<br>
<br>

Recently, a couple of opportunities has been popping up on the radar, with a call for 
developers to build stuff without the use of frameworks and whatnot which is breathtakingly insane if you ask me.<br>
This supports the opinion of Neo Ighodaro (<a href="https://twitter.com/NeoIghodaro">@NeoIghodaro</a>) CTO, 
hotels.ng who tweeted a time ago that developers should learn the core fundamentals of their languages or 
technology stack before fully immersing themselves in their accompanying frameworks. <br>
An example of that is the <a href="http://js13kgames.com/">JS13Kgames</a> challenge, which you are to build a 
functional game in Vanilla JavaScript {<i>no I do not mean Icecream, I mean pure bare-bones JavaScript</i>}that 
is no bigger than 13 kilobytes with no framework and other specifications. Also those other ones that I can't really talk about here. <br>
<i>{psst the Feds are listening shhhhh}</i>
