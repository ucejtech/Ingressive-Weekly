    <p>{<i> you do JavaScript then you should have an idea what hot reload is, a new piece of vocabulary 
    i picked up recently **shrugs** then opens a new page</i>}<br>
    Google decided to rebrand GDG in tertiary institution and call DSC with its major focus on traing students
    to have skills and collaborate to solve local problems in their various communities. <br>

    RAM next session. so watch out for them especially the workshops aimed at taking you from zero to one as 
    developers, which is really cool BTW.</p>
