       {NO! My God, NO! not that kind of official, I meant let's get things straight here, now
     have gotten to the third issue of this newsletter, I hope it's been fun for you just 
     like it's been for me this last couple of weeks. I mean I got to explore my own peculiar 
     likes for writing emails, trust me it's been hell configuring mail clients, double checking 
     grammar and whatnot but it is all worth it now because  you are reading it, Cheers.}

    <p><i>
    {I am sure you've heard that word "Ingressive" before, it 
    comes from the word 'Ingression', it means directed inward or entering and Yes it's the name of 
    the company supporting this newsletter. ingressive.co}
    </i>
    <br>
    This project means a lot to me personally and it has been in the works for over the past six (6) 
    months and I am glad that its going live officially under the moniker  'Ingressive Weekly' I know its 
    not really a big news but you know that feeling about accomplishing a goal, you'd be like YASSSSS thats literally 
    how I feel now. <br>
    PS. {<i>I know there a lot of I's here but i  couldn't have done it without Kratos or you folks reading 
        the newsletter. Thank you.</i>}</p>

    So Linux celebrated it's 25 years Anniversary last saturday the 25th August what a coincidence. You know whats 
    more wonderful than the fact that I was at a Linux Lagos meetup in Lagos where i meet awesome people and also 
    got to know about the upcoming Linux Fest happening at Start Zone, Gbagada, Lagos. from 18-20 October 2018 same 
    period with Dev-Ops Fest also in the same location, can you believe that. If you are in Lasgidi around that, try 
    to attend its gonna be awesome and I will also be onsite as a volunteer too, so try to come around and get a photo 
    with me so we could say 'Mushin' to the camera.  <br>
